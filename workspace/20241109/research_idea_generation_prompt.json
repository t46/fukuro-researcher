While its performance is impressive for its size,  LLMs in general often struggle with reasoning and logical deduction tasks. This can be attributed to their reliance on statistical patterns in the training data rather than explicit logical rules.  Furthermore, evaluating the performance of smaller LLMs like gemma-2-2b-it on complex reasoning tasks can be challenging due to the lack of widely accepted benchmarks tailored for their scale. \n\n**<proposition_idea>**\n\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose exploring **prompt engineering techniques specifically designed to guide gemma-2-2b-it towards better logical reasoning**. This could involve:\n\n* **Introducing structured input formats**:  Instead of relying solely on free-form text, experiment with prompting gemma-2-2b-it using structured data like knowledge graphs or decision trees. \n* **Incorporating logical operators**:  Train gemma-2-2b-it to understand and utilize logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) within prompts to guide its reasoning process. \n* **Utilizing iterative prompting**:  Develop a sequence of prompts that gradually lead gemma-2-2b-it towards the desired solution, incorporating intermediate steps and feedback mechanisms.\n\n\nThis approach focuses on leveraging gemma-2-2b-it's existing strengths while mitigating its weaknesses in logical reasoning through targeted prompt engineering. It is relatively simple to implement and has a high likelihood of feasibility given the existing research on prompt engineering for LLMs. ", "proposition_idea": "**\n\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose exploring **prompt engineering techniques specifically designed to guide gemma-2-2b-it towards better logical reasoning**.
